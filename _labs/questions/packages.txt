What are packages in Golang?
----------------------------
- Packages in Golang, which programmers may refer to as "Go packages," are directories that store Go files. 
- These Go files contain source code, so it is helpful for programmers to use Go packages to maintain records of Go files.
- Programmers store every piece of code, including functions and variables, in Go files.
- Then, they can transform these files into a single linked package.
- Within Golang, every source file resides in a package.
- It is also possible to place multiple packages inside a single larger package for easier organisation.

What are packages in a Go program?
--------------------------------
- Packages (pkg) are directories within your Go workspace that contain Go source files or other packages. 
- Every function, variable, and type from your source files are stored in the linked package. 
- Every Go source file belongs to a package, which is declared at the top of the file using:
  package <packagename>
- You can import and export packages to reuse exported functions or types using:
  import <packagename>
- Golangâ€™s standard package is fmt, which contains formatting and printing functionalities like Println().

List out the built in support in GO?
-------------------------------------
- The available built-in-support in GO includes:
  - Container: container/list , container/heap
  - Web Server: net/http
  - Cryptography: Crypto/md5 , crypto/sha1
  - Compression: compress/ gzip
  - Database: database/sql

  
What is the recommended Golang package for basic operations on files?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- The OS standard library package provides a platform-independent interface. 
- We use it for system functionality when working with files. 
- The OS interface is intended to be uniform across all operating systems. So the programs we create work the same on Windows, Linux, or Mac.

What other Golang packages are used to work with files?
-------------------------------------------------------
- There are other Go standard library packages, such as io, ioutil, and bufio. They work with files and provide more functionality.
