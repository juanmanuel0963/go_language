What kind of type conversion is supported by Go?
------------------------------------------------
- Go is very strict about explicit typing. 
- Go supports explicit type conversion to satisfy its strict typing requirements.
- There is no automatic type promotion or conversion. 
- Explicit type conversion is required to assign a variable of one type to another.

i := 55      //int
j := 67.8    //float64
sum := i + int(j) //j is converted to int
