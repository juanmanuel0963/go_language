How GC works in Go programming language?
----------------------------------------
- There are many garbage collection methods. 
- Go has a Mark-and-Sweep garbage collector. It works in two phases:
- Mark: 
  Start with Stop-the-world and set a write barrier to know how much was allocated during the mark phase.
  Mark all the memory that is still being used by the app. After that, remove the write barrier. 
- Sweep:
  The second phase is Sweep which happens after new allocations.
