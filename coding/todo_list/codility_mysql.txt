We have defined a table UserRole with the following structure:

CREATE TABLE UserRole (
	Id		bigint NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
	Name		varchar(100) NOT NULL,
	Description 	varchar(200) NULL,
	IsEnabled 	bit NOT NULL,
	Created 	date NOT NULL,
	CreatedBy 	varchar(200) NOT NULL,
	Updated 	date NULL,
	UpdatedBy 	varchar(200) NULL,
	CONSTRUAINT PK_UserRole PRIMARY KEY (Id ASC)
)

Your task is to write a SQL query (a report) that, for each user that has ever created (CreatedBy field) a role (Name field), will return four values:
- User name inthe UserName column;
- Number of created roles in the NoOfCreatedRoles column;
- Number of created roles that are enabled (IsEnabled field) in the NoOfCreatedAndEnabledRoles column;
- Number of updated roles in the NoOfUpdatedRoles column

Rows in the report should be sortedby user name in descending order. Additionally, user names should contain no leading or trailing white spaces and should be uppercase.

Your query should return no NULL values for numerical columns. Instead, NULL should be replaced with -1. For example, it is possible that there are no roles updated by a given user, or that there are no rolescreated by a given userthat are enabled.

You should also take into account that values in CreatedBy and UpdatedBy columns are not consistent:
- They can contain additional white spaces at the beginning or the end;
- They can be written using a mixture of small and capital letters, e.g. JOHN SMITH, john smith.

Hints:
- You can assume that there is at least one role created by each user.
- Your query will be executed agains MySQL 8.0 database

SOLUTION

WITH UserRolesCTE AS (
    SELECT
        UPPER(TRIM(CreatedBy)) AS UserName,
        COUNT(*) AS NoOfCreatedRoles,
        SUM(CAST(IsEnabled AS SIGNED)) AS NoOfCreatedAndEnabledRoles
    FROM UserRole
    GROUP BY UPPER(TRIM(CreatedBy))
),
UpdatedRolesCTE AS (
    SELECT
        UPPER(TRIM(UpdatedBy)) AS UserName,
        COUNT(*) AS NoOfUpdatedRoles
    FROM UserRole
    WHERE UpdatedBy IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY UPPER(TRIM(UpdatedBy))
)
SELECT
    UC.UserName,
    COALESCE(NoOfCreatedRoles, -1) AS NoOfCreatedRoles,
    COALESCE(NoOfCreatedAndEnabledRoles, -1) AS NoOfCreatedAndEnabledRoles,
    COALESCE(NoOfUpdatedRoles, -1) AS NoOfUpdatedRoles
FROM UserRolesCTE UC
LEFT JOIN UpdatedRolesCTE UR ON UC.UserName = UR.UserName
ORDER BY UC.UserName DESC;
