### Phase 1: Requirements Clarification

**Interviewer:**  
Today we’ll work on a data manipulation exercise. I need you to implement a function in Golang that groups words in a list according to their length. Words with the same length should be grouped together. The result should be a map where the key is the word length and the value is a list of words with that length.

Is the task clear, or do you have any questions?

**Candidate:**  
Just to confirm, you want me to return a map where the key is the length of the words and the value is a slice of all the words with that length?

**Interviewer:**  
Exactly. Don’t worry about the order in which the words appear in each slice, just focus on grouping them correctly. Is everything clear?

**Candidate:**  
Yes, it’s clear. I’ll start with the implementation.

### Phase 2: Implementation

**Candidate (thinking aloud):**  
I’ll start by creating a function that takes a slice of strings. Then, I’ll loop through each word, calculate its length, and add it to the map under the corresponding key. The structure of the map will be `map[int][]string`, where the key is the length of the word and the value is a slice of words with that length.

Let me write the code now:

```go
func GroupWordsByLength(words []string) map[int][]string {
	grouped := make(map[int][]string)
	for _, word := range words {
		length := len(word)
		grouped[length] = append(grouped[length], word)
	}
	return grouped
}
```

### Phase 3: Communication and Details

**Interviewer:**  
Great, can you explain your thought process?

**Candidate:**  
Sure. I created a map where the key is the length of the word. Then, I loop through the slice of words using a `for range` to calculate the length of each word with `len(word)`. After that, I use the length as the key in the map, and I use `append` to add the word to the corresponding list.

I initialized the map using `make` to avoid allocation issues. Finally, I return the map with all the words grouped.

**Interviewer:**  
That makes sense. Now, how would you handle edge cases?

---

### Phase 4: Edge Cases and Tests

**Candidate:**  
Some edge cases I see are:

1. If the list of words is empty, it should return an empty map.
2. If all words have the same length, they should all be in the same group.
3. If there’s only one word, the map should have just one entry.
4. If there are duplicate words, all instances should appear in the corresponding group.

I'll add some test cases to cover these edge cases:

```go
func TestGroupWordsByLength(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		input    []string
		expected map[int][]string
	}{
		{[]string{}, map[int][]string{}}, // Case 1: Empty list
		{[]string{"cat", "dog", "bat"}, map[int][]string{3: {"cat", "dog", "bat"}}}, // Case 2: All words have the same length
		{[]string{"hello"}, map[int][]string{5: {"hello"}}}, // Case 3: Only one word
		{[]string{"apple", "banana", "apple"}, map[int][]string{5: {"apple", "apple"}, 6: {"banana"}}}, // Case 4: Duplicate words
	}

	for _, test := range tests {
		result := GroupWordsByLength(test.input)
		if !reflect.DeepEqual(result, test.expected) {
			t.Errorf("Got %v, expected %v", result, test.expected)
		}
	}
}
```

### Phase 5: Incorporating Feedback

**Interviewer:**  
This looks very good. Now, what would you do if I asked you to add new functionality, like counting how many words there are in each group and returning that as well?

**Candidate:**  
We could modify the function to return both the map of words and an additional map with the count of words per length. The function would return two maps: one for grouping the words and another for counting how many words are in each group.

Let me make that modification:

```go
func GroupWordsByLengthWithCount(words []string) (map[int][]string, map[int]int) {
	grouped := make(map[int][]string)
	counts := make(map[int]int)
	for _, word := range words {
		length := len(word)
		grouped[length] = append(grouped[length], word)
		counts[length]++
	}
	return grouped, counts
}
```

Now the second map `counts` contains the number of words for each length.

---

### Phase 6: Testing the Solution

**Candidate:**  
I'll test the new functionality by adding test cases to verify if both the grouping and the count are correct.

```go
func TestGroupWordsByLengthWithCount(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		input         []string
		expectedGroup map[int][]string
		expectedCount map[int]int
	}{
		{[]string{}, map[int][]string{}, map[int]int{}},
		{[]string{"cat", "dog", "bat"}, map[int][]string{3: {"cat", "dog", "bat"}}, map[int]int{3: 3}},
		{[]string{"hello"}, map[int][]string{5: {"hello"}}, map[int]int{5: 1}},
		{[]string{"apple", "banana", "apple"}, map[int][]string{5: {"apple", "apple"}, 6: {"banana"}}, map[int]int{5: 2, 6: 1}},
	}

	for _, test := range tests {
		resultGroup, resultCount := GroupWordsByLengthWithCount(test.input)
		if !reflect.DeepEqual(resultGroup, test.expectedGroup) || !reflect.DeepEqual(resultCount, test.expectedCount) {
			t.Errorf("Got %v and %v, expected %v and %v", resultGroup, resultCount, test.expectedGroup, test.expectedCount)
		}
	}
}
```

### Phase 7: Final Discussion

**Interviewer:**  
I like how you've handled the modifications. Do you see any drawbacks in this approach, or improvements you could suggest?

**Candidate:**  
The solution is efficient for most common cases. However, if we were dealing with a very large list of words, we might consider optimizations regarding memory allocation or even parallelizing the processing using goroutines if the problem requires high concurrency.

Another improvement could be to add validation to ensure that the words don’t contain invalid or empty characters, although this wasn’t specifically requested for this exercise.

**Interviewer:**  
Good observation. That would be all for now! Thank you.

**Candidate:**  
Thank you!
