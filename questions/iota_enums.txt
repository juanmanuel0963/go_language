What is an idiomatic way of representing enums in Go?
-----------------------------------------------------
- Golang programming language does not support enums directly.
- You can implement enums using iota and constants.
- You can implement an enumerated type using the following methods:
  - By creating a new integer type
  - By listing its value using iota
  - By giving the type a String function


The iota keyword represents successive integer constants 0, 1, 2,â€¦
It resets to 0 whenever the word const appears in the source code,
and increments after each const specification.

const (
	C0 = iota
	C1 = iota
	C2 = iota
)
fmt.Println(C0, C1, C2) // "0 1 2"

This can be simplified to

const (
	C0 = iota
	C1
	C2
)
