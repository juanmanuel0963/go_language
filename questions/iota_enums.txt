What is an idiomatic way of representing enums in Go?
-----------------------------------------------------
- Golang programming language does not support enums directly.
- You can implement enums using iota and constants.
- You can implement an enumerated type using the following methods:
  - By creating a new integer type
  - By listing its value using iota
  - By giving the type a String function
