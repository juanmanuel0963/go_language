How is GoPATH different from GoROOT variables in Go?
----------------------------------------------------

c:\go env

GOROOT=C:\Program Files\Go
- Where the Go SDK is located.
- The GoROOT determines the location of Go SDK

GOPATH=C:\Users\Juan Manuel\go
- The GoPATH determines the root of the workspace
- The source and the binaries of Go Projects.

How can you configure working environments and parameters? 
----------------------------------------------------------
- You can configure working environments and parameters using JSON, commonly used these days.
- The major advantage of using JSON is that it is available in the standard library. 
- The standard library offers methods to write the data structure intended, which makes it quite readable.
- Another alternative is to use the YAML package for Go.
