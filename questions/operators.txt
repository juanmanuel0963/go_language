What is the difference between the = and := operator?
-----------------------------------------------------
- In Go, := is for declaration + assignment, 
- whereas = is for assignment only.
- For example, var foo int = 10 is the same as foo := 10.

What are Lvalue and Rvalue in Golang?
-------------------------------------
- Lvalue:
  - Refers to a memory location
  - Represents a variable identifier
  - Mutable
  - May appear on the left or right side of the = operator
  - For example: In the statement x = 20, x is an lvalue and 20 is an rvalue.
- Rvalue:
  - Represents a data value stored in memory
  - Represents a constant value
  - Always appears on the = operatorâ€™s right side.

- For example, The statement 10 = 20 is invalid because there is an rvalue (10) left of the = operator.
